# Competitive Programming

In this repository, I have compiled a collection of templates for frequently used data structures and algorithms in competitive programming. As a competitive programmer, I have participated in coding contests on multiple online platforms such as Codeforces and Codechef. I am grateful to have achieved a **candidate master** ranking on Codeforces and a **5-star** coder ranking on Codechef, which has allowed me to gain a better understanding of the skills necessary to succeed in this field. I hope that these templates can be of use to other competitive programmers looking to improve their skills.

## Overview

Competitive programming is a highly competitive sport that requires a great deal of skill and knowledge. The templates in this repository cover a wide range of topics and provide an easy way to implement various data structures and algorithms that are essential to succeed in coding contests.

The templates in this repository are organized by topic and cover a broad range of data structures and algorithms including:

- Data Structures: Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, Disjoint Set Union, Trie.
- Graph Algorithms: Lowest Common Ancestor.
- Number Theory: Modular Arithmetic.

## Usage

Using these templates is simple. You can just copy the code and paste it into your source file. Make sure to include any necessary headers and modify the code to suit your needs.

One of the advantages of using these templates is that they are written in an easy-to-understand manner. They are designed to be concise and efficient, allowing you to focus on solving the problem at hand rather than getting bogged down in complicated code.

Moreover, these templates are well-documented with comments that explain the purpose of each function and data structure, making it easier for you to understand the code and make modifications to it.

## Contributing

This repository is open to contributions. If you have a template that you think would be a valuable addition to this repository, feel free to submit a pull request. However, before submitting a pull request, please make sure that your template is well-documented, follows good coding practices, and is thoroughly tested.
