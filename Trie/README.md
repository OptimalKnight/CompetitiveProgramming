# Trie

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval and storage of strings or sequences of characters. Each node in the trie represents a prefix or a complete string, and the edges represent the characters in the string. Tries can be used for a variety of tasks such as spell checking, auto-completion, and IP routing, and they have a time complexity of O(m) for insertion, search, and deletion operations, where m is the length of the string.
