# Disjoing Set Union

Disjoint set union, also known as union-find data structure, is a data structure that allows efficiently managing a collection of disjoint sets. Each set is represented by a unique root element, and elements within the same set share the same root element. The data structure supports two main operations: union, which merges two sets into a single set, and find, which determines the root element (i.e., the representative) of the set to which an element belongs. Disjoint set union has many applications, including in graph algorithms, image processing, and computer science education.
