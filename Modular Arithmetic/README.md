# Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic where calculations are performed modulo a fixed integer, called the modulus. In modular arithmetic, the result of an operation is the remainder of that operation when divided by the modulus. For example, in modulo 5 arithmetic, 6 + 4 = 5 because the remainder of 6 + 4 when divided by 5 is 1. Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science and cryptography, as it allows computations to be performed efficiently using limited hardware resources.
