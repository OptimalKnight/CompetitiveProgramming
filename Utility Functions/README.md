# Utility Functions

Ceiling: In mathematics, the ceiling function, denoted by the symbol ⌈ x ⌉, is a mathematical function that rounds a number up to the nearest integer. For example, the ceiling of 2.4 is 3, the ceiling of 5 is 5, and the ceiling of -3.7 is -3.

GCD: The greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the highest common factor (HCF), is the largest positive integer that divides two or more integers without leaving a remainder. For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, as 6 is the largest integer that divides both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder.

Power function: The power function is a mathematical function that takes a base number and raises it to an exponent. For example, the power function of x raised to the exponent of n is denoted as x^n. The result of the power function is the base number multiplied by itself n times. For example, 2^3 is equal to 2 multiplied by itself three times, which equals 8.
